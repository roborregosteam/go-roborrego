## Key Conventions

### Server vs Client Components

- **Server components** handle auth checks, initial data fetching, and passing props to client components.
- **Client components** (`"use client"`) handle all interactivity and tRPC mutations.
- **Pass role/userId as props** from server → client. Do not call `useSession()` or `auth()` in client components.

```tsx
// page.tsx (server)
export default async function Page() {
  const session = await auth();
  return <ClientComponent isAdmin={session?.user.role === "ADMIN"} />;
}
```

### Server Actions for Auth

Use server actions (not `href` links) for sign-in and sign-out to bypass NextAuth's default confirmation pages:

```tsx
// Direct Google sign-in — skips provider selector page
<form action={async () => { "use server"; await signIn("google", { redirectTo: "/dashboard" }); }}>

// Direct sign-out — skips confirmation page
// Pass as prop from server layout → client component
signOutAction={async () => { "use server"; await signOut({ redirectTo: "/" }); }}
```

### tRPC Procedures

Four procedure types with escalating access:

| Procedure | Who can call |
|---|---|
| `publicProcedure` | Anyone |
| `protectedProcedure` | Any logged-in user |
| `memberProcedure` | MEMBER or ADMIN role |
| `adminProcedure` | ADMIN role only |

Defined in `src/server/api/trpc.ts`.

### Cache Invalidation

Always use `void` when invalidating without awaiting:

```ts
void utils.member.getDirectory.invalidate();
```

### Component Co-location

Feature-specific components live in `_components/` inside the route folder:

```
app/dashboard/workplan/_components/ActivitiesTab.tsx
```

Shared dashboard components live in `app/dashboard/_components/`.

---

## Auth

- Provider: **Google OAuth only** — any email domain is accepted (no `@tec.mx` restriction)
- **Allowlist-based**: users must be pre-registered by an admin before they can sign in
- Bootstrap exception: if the DB has zero users, the first sign-in is allowed (creates the first admin)
- Role is stored on the `User` model and included in the session
- Role in session is typed as `"VIEWER" | "MEMBER" | "ADMIN"` (string literal union, not the Prisma enum import — avoids type conflicts)
- `lastLoginAt` is updated via the `signIn` event in `config.ts`

---

## File Uploads (Supabase Storage)

Upload flow uses signed URLs to avoid exposing the service role key to the browser:

1. Client calls `POST /api/upload/sign` with `{ bucket, path, contentType }`
2. Server generates a signed upload URL using the service role key
3. Client `PUT`s the file directly to Supabase
4. Public URL is constructed and saved to the DB

Two buckets: `avatars` (public) and `task-attachments` (private, signed URLs).

The `useUpload` hook at `src/lib/useUpload.ts` handles this flow.

---

## MCP Servers

### Stdio server (`npm run mcp`)

Runs locally via `tsx src/mcp/server.ts`. No auth — whoever runs the process has full access. Useful for local admin tooling and Claude Desktop integration.

Claude Desktop config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "roborrego": {
      "command": "npm",
      "args": ["run", "mcp"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/go-roborrego"
    }
  }
}
```

### HTTP MCP endpoint (`POST /api/mcp`)

Authenticated via `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`. API keys:
- One key per user, generated from `/dashboard/profile/edit`
- Expire 3 hours after generation
- Stored as SHA-256 hash in the `ApiKey` table
- Carry the same permissions as the owning user (VIEWER = read-only, MEMBER = read + create_task, ADMIN = all tools)

`GET /api/mcp` returns discovery info without auth.

---

## Known Gotchas

### Prisma Client Location

The client is generated to `generated/prisma/` (root level, not inside `src/`). This path is **excluded from tsconfig**, but imports still work. Always use a **relative path**:

```ts
// src/server/db.ts — correct
import { PrismaClient } from "../../generated/prisma";

// src/server/auth/config.ts — correct
import type { Role } from "../../../generated/prisma";

// src/app/api/mcp/route.ts — correct
import type { Prisma } from "../../../../generated/prisma";
```

Do **not** use `~/generated/prisma` — the `~` alias maps to `src/`, so that path does not exist.

### Prisma Client Staleness

After any schema change, the generated client must be regenerated and the dev server restarted:

```bash
npx prisma generate   # or npx prisma db push (includes generate)
# then restart: npm run dev
```

Runtime errors like `Unknown field X for include statement` mean the running process has a stale client.

### NextAuth Adapter Type Conflict

`@auth/prisma-adapter` and `next-auth` bundle separate copies of `@auth/core`, causing `AdapterUser` type incompatibilities when you extend the `User` model. Workaround in `src/server/auth/config.ts`:

```ts
adapter: PrismaAdapter(db) as any,
```

Do **not** augment the `interface User` in the `next-auth` module declaration — only augment `interface Session`.

### Tailwind v4 Class Names

Tailwind v4 renamed several utilities. Use the new canonical names:

| Old (v3) | New (v4) |
|---|---|
| `bg-gradient-to-b` | `bg-linear-to-b` |

### Passing Server Actions to Client Components

To use a server action (e.g. `signOut`) inside a client component, define it inline in the server layout/page and pass it as a typed prop:

```tsx
// layout.tsx (server)
<ClientComp action={async () => { "use server"; await signOut(); }} />

// ClientComp.tsx
({ action }: { action: () => Promise<void> }) => <form action={action}>…</form>
```

## Database Schema Summary

Key models and their purpose:

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `User` | Members — includes role, status, approved profile fields |
| `ProfileEdit` | Pending/approved/rejected profile change requests |
| `ApiKey` | Per-user API key for HTTP MCP access (hashed, 3h TTL) |
| `Semester` | Work plan semester (one active at a time) |
| `WorkPlanActivity` | Activity within a semester (points, mandatory flag) |
| `WorkPlanInterest` | Member ↔ activity interest (many-to-many) |
| `WorkPlanCompletion` | Submitted completion awaiting admin approval |
| `Meeting` | Team meeting with QR check-in token, optional project link |
| `Attendance` | Member check-in record per meeting |
| `MeetingFeedback` | Anonymous or named feedback per meeting |
| `Project` | Team project (can be private) |
| `ProjectMember` | Member ↔ project role (PROJECT_MEMBER / PROJECT_MANAGER) |
| `Task` | Task within a project (Kanban board) |
| `TaskAssignee` | Member ↔ task assignment |
| `TaskComment` | Comment on a task |
| `Account`, `Session`, `VerificationToken` | NextAuth internals — do not modify |

### Roles & Status Enums

```prisma
enum Role              { VIEWER  MEMBER  ADMIN }
enum MemberStatus      { ACTIVE  INACTIVE  ALUMNI }
enum CompletionStatus  { PENDING  APPROVED  REJECTED }
enum ProfileEditStatus { PENDING  APPROVED  REJECTED }
enum ProjectStatus     { ACTIVE  COMPLETED  ARCHIVED }
enum ProjectRole       { PROJECT_MEMBER  PROJECT_MANAGER }
enum TaskStatus        { TODO  IN_PROGRESS  IN_REVIEW  DONE }
enum TaskPriority      { LOW  MEDIUM  HIGH  URGENT }
enum AttendanceMethod  { QR_CODE  MANUAL  SELF }
```

### Project visibility rules

- `isPrivate = false` → visible to all authenticated users
- `isPrivate = true` → visible only to project members and ADMINs
- Enforced in `project.getAll` (server-side WHERE clause) and `project.getById` (post-fetch check)

### Admin-only project roles

ADMIN users always hold `PROJECT_MANAGER` role on any project they join — enforced in `addMember` and blocked in `updateMemberRole`. Users cannot change their own project role.

### Profile edit approval flow

1. Member submits profile changes → `ProfileEdit` created with `PENDING` status. `User` fields unchanged.
2. Admin reviews at `/dashboard/admin/profile-approvals` — sees current vs proposed diff.
3. On approval → proposed non-null fields are copied to `User`. On rejection → only status updated.
4. Submitting again while a pending edit exists replaces the old pending edit.
5. `image` (avatar) bypasses approval — applied directly to `User`.

## Running Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the database (Docker)
./start-database.sh

# Push schema and generate client
npm run db:push

# Start dev server (exposed on Tailscale / all interfaces)
npm run dev    # or: ./dev.sh
```

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:

```
AUTH_SECRET=                    # run: npx auth secret
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=                 # Google Cloud Console OAuth client
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=
DATABASE_URL=                   # PostgreSQL connection string

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=       # Supabase project URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=  # Supabase anon/public key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=      # Supabase service role key (server-only)
```

### Supabase Storage Setup

Create two buckets in Supabase Storage:
- `avatars` — **public** read
- `task-attachments` — **private** (signed URLs only)

Add a public-read policy on `avatars`:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public read avatars" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');
```

### MCP stdio server

```bash
npm run mcp   # runs tsx src/mcp/server.ts
```
